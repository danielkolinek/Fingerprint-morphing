# Thesis: Evaluation of Fingerprint Morphing Methods Compared to a Real System

## Abstract
The aim of this work is to design methods of fingerprint morphing, subsequently to implement the proposed methods and to test their effectiveness by breaking into real verification systems made by Innovatrics and Neurotechnology, two prominent companies in biometrics. Methods for morphing were designed mainly based on the article On the Feasibility of Creating Double-Identity Fingerprints where the part of the preparation of fingerprints on the input was modified and an adjustment of the output was made so that it is able to work with fingerprint images taken under different conditions. Fingerprints created by morphing were recognized as genuine in 41.72 % of cases when compared to the default threshold. The main benefit of this work is the created application for generating fingerprints using morphing and to point out that this method is a threat to existing systems used for fingerprint recognition.
